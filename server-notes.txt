Need to install the following packages

node install csv-parse
node install elementtree
npm install rander
npm install ya-csv

-In the Node directory is a MarkerData.csv file and a /locations folder. Move these to the root www folder on the server. 
-All HTML files will need to be updated with the URL to these server files.
-If the server-side files are on a different machine than the HTML pages, then you'll need to configure the server for this with the HTTP header.
